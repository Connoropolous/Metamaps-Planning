Important Labels to understand:

[Address @ Meeting] - Issues that have been tagged to bring up during out next meeting

[GEN003 Task Pool] - Issues that might not quite be ready for the new GEN003 repo, but are definitely close... These issues can be drawn from once the GEN003 issues are depleted.


Example of a repo with a good wiki and formatting:
